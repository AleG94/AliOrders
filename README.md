**AliOrders** is a *mobile app* that helps you keep track of the buyer protection period of your *AliExpress* orders so you never forget about them. 

Having everything in one place is especially useful if you place orders from *multiple accounts* so you can take timely decisions (contact the seller or open a dispute) without having to check the *AliExpress* app and switch between your accounts very often.

## Features

* **Manage orders** - add orders, view a list sorted by closing date and delete them once they have been completed
* **Notifications** - receive notifications before (7 days, 3 days and 1 day) and after buyer protection ends
